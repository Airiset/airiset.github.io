My name is Eric Pimentel (pee-men-TEL). I am a software engineer based in
Toronto, Canada. I am passionate about programming language and compiler
design, as well as systems engineering.

I spend my free time reading, watching comedy movies (rom-coms are my
favourite). I also dable in some amateur cooking, using my family as test
subjects for my recipes. I have mastered chili-making, and I am proud of
my secret recipe.

I was born and raised in the Dominican Republic, and moved to Canada when
I was 14. Now, I am a proud Canadian citizen, but you might still feel
a Hispanic accent when I speak.

Welcome to my blog!
